## PERN Todo App

This is a fullstack PERN (Postgresql, Express, React, Node) Todo Application. The app is fairly simple but you can do all the CRUD functionalities and everything is stored nicely on a remote database. This app was a pleasure to make and an excellent learning opportunity since I had to implement everything from the group up and bring together everything I had learned so far. I decided not to use a database ORM and instead just use the PG node package to do all my database related calls.

Just a little heads up ... it might not load properly on your first attempt. This is not a bug or an issue. It only means that the Heroku dynos was sleeping. Give him a few F5s and he'll wake up.
